    <p>
        In fair Verona where we lay our scene,<br>
        Two star-crossed lovers, caught in fate's keen.<br>
        Their hearts entwined, a bond so deep,<br>
        Amidst the feuds, their love they keep.
    </p>
    <p>
        Through whispered vows in the moonlit night,<br>
        They dared to dream, to seek the light.<br>
        But shadows loomed, and tragedy came,<br>
        Love's gentle spark became a flame.
    </p>
    <p>
        A secret kiss, a potion’s brew,<br>
        Two worlds apart, yet love still grew.<br>
        With every heartbeat, their fate entwined,<br>
        In death, their love, forever enshrined.
    </p>
    <p>
        So here’s to love, in darkness and light,<br>
        A tale of passion that burns so bright.<br>
        For even in sorrow, love's flame will endure,<br>
        In hearts of the faithful, forever pure.
